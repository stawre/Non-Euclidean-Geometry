generate_menger works perfectly by itself (setting nesting_level_ manually in code), however, implemented with key presses "0-4", it only displays correctly with 0 and 1. 
the current nesting level is set artificially to 3, and the buttons 0 and 1 working (to demonstrate working menger calculation).
